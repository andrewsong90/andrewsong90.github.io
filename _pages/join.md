We are always looking for talented and highly-motivated colleagues of all levels to join the Song lab (starting in January of 2026). The research group is part of [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/)'s [Department of Translational Molecular Pathology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/translational-molecular-pathology.html) and [The Institute for Data Science in Oncology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/institutes/institute-for-data-science-in-oncology.html).

Please carefully follow the instructions and send additional requested materials to andrewsong90@gmail.com. Due to the high number of emails from prospective students, I won't be able to reply to all emails.

<h3>Research agenda</h3>

The research group is dedicated to building next-generation AI tools for computational pathology, grounded in rigorous principles of statistical inference, with the overarching goal of deciphering multi-scale oncologic complexity. The lab’s research will focus on developing state-of-the-art AI models capable of integrating and cross-analyzing diverse data modalities—such as tissue images, spatial transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and clinical reports—across multiple dimensions of clinical data (2D, 3D, and 4D longitudinal datasets). By combining these innovations with advanced statistical approaches such as Bayesian inference and optimal transport, the lab aims to open new frontiers in computational pathology and precision oncology.

Successful candidates will have a unique opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research while shaping the strategic direction of several flagship initiatives at MD Anderson, as it launches mission-critical, well-funded programs in digital and molecular pathology.

Based in the world’s leading cancer center within the largest medical complex in the world, the candidates will have direct access to one of the most comprehensive patient tissue and clinical trial data. In addition to the vibrant and rich cancer research ecosystem within Houston, the candidates will have exciting opportunities to collaborate extensively with external collaborators in academia as well as industrial partners to foster translational impact at scale. MD Anderson also provides a wealth of computational resources, including high-performance computing clusters tailored for biomedical research and on-demand access to the Texas Advanced Computing Center.


<h3> :pencil2: Postdoctoral fellows</h3>
Fully-funded full-time postdoctoral fellow positions are available, where additional mentorship will be provided by Dr. Donna Hansel, the Division head of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.
