[[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/Andrew_Resume_latest.pdf)] (Updated: Sept. 2025)

**I will start my lab at Department of Translational Molecular Pathology & Institute of Data Science in Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Jan. 2026!!! Official recruitment posting for postdocs and graduate students will be made soon, so stay tuned.**

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard medical school, working with Professor [Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/). I also closely collaborate with Professors [Jonathan Liu](https://med.stanford.edu/jonliulab.html) and [Sizun Jiang](https://sizunjianglab.com/). My current research interests are (1) 3D computational pathology, (2) Multimodal deep learning in pathology, (3) Biomedical signal processing, and (4) Statistical inference frameworks.

Previously, I received Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in Feb. 2022, with a focus on neural signal processing, co-advised by Professors [Emery N. Brown](https://picower.mit.edu/emery-n-brown) (MIT) and [Demba Ba](https://crisp.seas.harvard.edu/index.html) (Harvard). I have Bachelorâ€™s & M.Eng. degrees, all in EECS, from MIT. I also served in Republic of Korea Army for two years, during which I was stationed at Tyre, Lebanon as a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a year.
