I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard medical school, working with Professor [Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/). My current research interests are 1) 3D and 2D computational pathology, 2) Multimodal deep learning in pathology, and 3) Biomedical signal processing.

Previously, I received Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) with a focus on neural signal processing, co-advised by Professors Emery N. Brown (MIT) and Demba Ba (Harvard). I also have Bachelorâ€™s & M.Eng. degrees, all in EECS, from MIT.  I served in Republic of Korea Army for two years, during which I worked as a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a year.
