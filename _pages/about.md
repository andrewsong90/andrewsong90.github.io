I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard medical school, working with Professor Faisal Mahmood. My current research interests are 1) 3D and 2D computational pathology, 2) Multimodal deep learning, and 3) Biomedical signal processing.

I received Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), co-advised by Professors Emery N. Brown (MIT) and Demba Ba (Harvard). I was a member of Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory (NSRL) @ MIT and Computation, Representation, Inference in Signal Processing (CRISP) group @ Harvard. I also have Bachelorâ€™s & M.Eng. degrees, all in EECS, from MIT.  I served in Republic of Korea Army for two years, during which I worked as a UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a year.
